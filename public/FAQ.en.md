## <a name="step1">What is  <strong>KBANK OPEN API</strong>?</a>

<b>KBANK OPEN API</b> is a set of APIs that allow you to connect to core KBank financial functionality. Whether you are an established retailer who is looking for a payment gateway or other financial technologies such as account data, payment via QR code, our APIs seek to enable your product and its features.

<br>

## <a name="step2"> What kind of data and access do I get in the portal?</a>

Our portal consists of a ‘sandbox’, which allows you to make API calls that are the same in form and function to our production environments. It contains mock data so that you can prototype your application as if it were real things. We keep our public APIs sandbox to protect our clients’ data and validate products before moving them to production.

<br>

## <a name="step3">What functionality is available in the sandbox?</a>

Our functionality varies from region to region – though we provide simulated access to our points platform, customer profiles, accounts, and transactions across all regions. To see if your desired functionality is available in your product’s region, be sure to check out our API catalog and documentation. Please be reminded that this is a sandbox, which means a test environment, that only uses dummy data.

<br>

## <a name="step4">What does it cost me?</a>

Currently, There are no fees to access our sandbox. If we allow you to move beyond the sandbox, at that time we can discuss next steps and pricing.

<br>

## <a name="step5">Can KBank provide more APIs, if I have an idea for APIs that would really enable my product?</a>
